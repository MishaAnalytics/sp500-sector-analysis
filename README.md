## 🎯 Project Goal

The main goal of this project is to explore how different market sectors correlate with the S&P 500 over time.  
Through this project, I practiced:

- Loading and cleaning real-world CSV financial data  
- Aggregating sector averages  
- Visualizing trends using Matplotlib  
- Structuring a small-scale data analysis pipeline

All financial data was sourced from **World Data Bank**, ensuring the datasets are reliable and representative of real market trends.

This work helped me improve my analytical thinking, Python programming, and understanding of financial datasets.
